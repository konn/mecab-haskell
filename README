* Known Bugs
Storable instance for MeCabNode isn't written appropriately.
e.g. `length' field of MeCabNode is filed with strange length

For now, I use c_length C-function instead.
I'm investigating why.

* Known bugs
- Support N-best answers.
- Pointer becomes null when used from compiled program.
  From ghci, it works correctly.
